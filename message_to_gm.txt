To Nova and GM Team:

I am a Nova player and I am a undergraduate computer science student. I am currently building an in-game market tracker that will notify user when an item is on sell (under their ideal price), and I would use Discord bot to DM the user.

This project is mainly for me to practice programming and I am not sure it would actually be solid enough to become a real application. (but seems  possible)

I am writing to ask for permission to web scraping on the nova market website. Essentially this is how I am getting the data, without an API. I am willing to share the code for monitoring purposes.

I am really excited about this self project and it would benefit many players in game and keep the game server growth. (I plan to make it a free application even if it is good enough for players to use, if it sucks, it would still be good practice) Thanks in advance.

PS Love this server, my first RO server

Sincerely,

IGN Babyish Love
